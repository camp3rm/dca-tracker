# 🪙 DCA Tracker — Smart Crypto Investment Dashboard

**DCA Tracker** is a modern web application for monitoring crypto investments based on the **Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)** strategy.  
The platform allows users to **track purchases**, **analyze portfolio profitability**, **plan selling strategies**, and **assess risk** for each coin — all without Excel or third-party trackers.

## 🔍 Core Idea

Most crypto investors make small regular purchases but lack a tool to:

- Record every transaction  
- Track ROI in real time  
- Calculate potential profit targets  
- Visualize portfolio performance over time  

**DCA Tracker** solves this by providing a unified, interactive dashboard with analytics, charts, and smart planning tools.
